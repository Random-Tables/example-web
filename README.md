# Web Example - Random Tables


This is an example of how to integrate the Random Table engine into a webpage, this example is aimed at beginner/non-coders, please reach out if you have any confusion so I fix anything that is unclear.

## Random Table Engine

The Random Table engine is a javascript library & a set of standards to help build random tables that use a theasaurus-like selection of variables to sprinkle in more depth of description, these range from a wide array of colors eg: 
red -> can be replaced by:
      "crimson",
      "rouge",
      "indian red",
      "amber",
      "orange",
      "clay red",
      "apricot"

Along with other utility libraries such as names.

Hopefully people can also build their own descriptive libraries and share them.
